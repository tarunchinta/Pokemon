INITIAL STAGE:
* Your screen will open on an initial stage with your player character. Use the arrow keys to control the player’s movement. To begin the game, move toward the attendant to prompt dialogue.

SELECTION STAGE: 
* This is the beginning of the game, where you are presented with an option of different Pokemon to select your team. Hover over the options to see the stats and display of each Pokemon. Each Pokemon has a different type: Fire, Water, Grass or Normal. Strategize your best team with your choice of Pokemon types to make sure you can beat your opponent! Be careful, because after you pick your team, you cannot change it.
* To choose a Pokemon, click on the image of the Pokemon from the option list. This will insert your Pokemon into your final team list depicted at the bottom of the screen. To deselect, just click on the image again and it will undo your selection. 
* When you are satisfied with your team, click the Confirm Team button to move onto the battle stage of the game! You cannot move to the battle stage unless you have 3 pokemon in your team.


BATTLE STAGE: 
* You are now in the battle arena where you can see who your opponent is! The bottom of the screen will have a standard 4 moves (changing depending on the pokemon in play) that you are allowed to use for each turn. If you hover over the options, you will be able to see the stats of the move and how powerful they are. Once you decide which move you want to play, click on the move and an animation will indicate that you have played your turn. 
* Once you play your turn, you will see how much damage you have done to your opponent with the HP bar visible at the top of the Pokemon image. 
* Then the opponent will play and you will be prompted with text to see whichmove they played on you. You can also see your own HP bar to see how much damage you took. 
* After the opponent plays, your move option list will return, and you can play another turn. If your first Pokemon dies, the next Pokemon in your team will enter and you can play until all your Pokemon die; hopefully, you win! If your opponent’s pokemon dies, they will also play their next pokemon.
* If all 3 pokemon in your team faint, your highscore (how many opponents you have defeated) will be saved. If you defeat all 3 of your opponents pokemon, you will automatically start a new battle with a new opponent. You will continuously battle opponents until you lose.
* Once you are defeated, you will be returned to the lobby, and may see your highscore by talking to the attendant, or you may play a new game. Enjoy!
